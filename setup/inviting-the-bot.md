# Inviting the bot

## Inviting the bot

Apache is incredibly easy to invite to your server. Simply visit [your dashboard](https://dashboard.apachebot.net), and click on your server's icon, and you will be redirected to a page to invite the bot to your server.

## Customising the bot

Once the bot has joined your server, there are a couple of ways that you can customise your experience. You can either manage the bot from the Discord client through commands, or you can visit your [dashboard](https://dashboard.apachebot.net) and manage the bot from there. \
\
The bot has a wide range of customisability, with the ability to restrict commands to certain roles and users, to enabling and disabling specific commands and command groups, absolutely everything about this bot can be customised to your liking.&#x20;

There are plans to implement a feature to allow users to create their own custom bot that will be hosted in the cloud, this will allow users to have custom profile pictures and usernames for their bots without having to worry about hosting it themselves.
